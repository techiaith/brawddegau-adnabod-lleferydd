# Welsh Speech Recognition Sentences

[Darllen y README yn Gymraeg](README.md)

This is collection of Welsh language sentences released under a CC0 license and collected by members of the Language Technologies Unit, Bangor University expressly to serve as prompts for recrding audio to be used to train Welsh Speech Recognition models. As a result, the sentences are reasonably short and do not contain less common characters and symbols.

These sentences were also submitted to Mozilla's Common Voice project, and these sentences were therefore used for volunteer recording.

These sentences have also been contributed to the Mozilla Common Voice project to be recorded by volunteers.

## Sentences Collected from Welsh language sources

The file [`data/cy.txt`](data/cy.txt) is a collection of 14,857 sentences collected from various sources and include:

* Original sentences
* Sentences from novels, essays and other out of copyright material
* Sentences from the Welsh Wicipedia where authors gave us permission to release them under a CC0 licence
* Tweets, emails, and other electronic material gifted to the project to be used as prompts

In a number of cases, the language was adapted and the sentences heavily edited to make them suitable for reading aloud by volunteers.

This corpus also forms part of a larger CC0 corpus found at https://github.com/techiaith/corpws-CC0.

We wish to thank everyone who helped us collect these sentences, including those who gave us their materials under a CC0 licence, and to Mozilla for their help and leadership with the Common Voice project.
